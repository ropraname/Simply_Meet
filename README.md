Here you can find new friends, a study-buddy or just a good company for a joint activity(in MISIS).

- Search for a pair based on interests.
By choosing your interests when registering, you can find someone with whom you can, for example, study mathematics.

If you want to join an existing couple, then you should go to the pairs view and click the join button.
- Search and create events
By choosing your interests during registration and going to the events section,
you can either create your own event and invite people, for example,
play a board game together, or join existing events using the event viewer.
- Recommendations
Having chosen your interests when registering, using recommendations,
you can ask the bot to find you a new friend from another community by asking specific interests.
